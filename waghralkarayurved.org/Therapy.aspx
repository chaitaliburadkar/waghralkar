					<h6>IMPORTANCE OF MUSIC IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE</h6>
						<p>Music is closely associated with nature. It will also not be wrong to say that the origin of nature is through sound. And atoms always establish communication with each other.
Wherever there is motion there always is a sound, states the law of science. And in absence of sound, the nature would not have been created. This slows the importance of sound in the creation of this nature. And if all these facts are to be interlinked, one thing emerges very clear- that the music that has its origin in some will always remain a boon to the human being as it helps establish communication with each other with a touch of softness.
The origin of Indian music finds its roots in the principle of creativity. Indian music always attaches importance to calm and thoughtful emotions, while the western music encourages provocative emotions. In the ancient times. The Vedic religion, was spread in the entire world which had no castes, religions and creeds as its base. And this tradition was maintained in Bharat. The roots of Vedic culture has been deeply rooted in our land as it advocated clam and thoughtful feelings.
To strike concentration of mind is the most important aim of Indian music. Liberation of mind from the bondages of life and death is the aim of Indian music. In the ancient times, the seers were using music as a tool to attain ‘Moksha’.
The Indian music helps one to concentrate. The law of Physiology says that when the mind is concentrated, the blood circulation is balanced. And in such a body, where blood circulation is regulated, there is hardly any disease.
The ‘ragas’ in Indian music are also based on the principles which provide for experience of different stages of human feelings like irritation, happiness, sorrow etc. Some human feelings like irritation, happiness, sorrow etc. Some happenings in the word outside are, therefore necessary for the creation of these beats. A continuous of music has revealed that some specific ‘ragas’ has the power to experience the feeling like happiness, sorrow, pain and anger. For example, raga ‘Todi’ is powerful enough to make one cry, while ‘Shankhadhvani’ make the mind fresh. The ragas like ‘Bhairavi’ makes one to become unattached to the worldly things while yaman creates serene, feelings. Raga ‘Kambhoji’ develops sexual feelings.
If one were to give an example of day-to-day life, a child will certainly sleep fast if a luilaby is sung. If the were to be awakened again, a pure tune can do it. The Songs like ‘ Uthi Uthi Fopala’ are, therefore, based on this principle.
All these things prove beyond doubt that music certainly plays a positive-both inner and outer-role on the human body. Yogiraj Harkare, a well known spiritual personality, has done a lot of research in this field and has been successful in making patients free from diseases.
Whether the effects of music can do wonders in day-to-day life can be subject to research, but experience shows that the experiment of using music as a tool to improve working capacity will certainly give rich dividends. This is because the base of Indian music is to promote spirituality. And it is therefore obvious that after the holy, pure feeling are developed; the human being knows his duties well and spends his life in discharging his duties properly.

										<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
